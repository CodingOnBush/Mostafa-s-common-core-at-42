# webserv
I'm going to explain everything about webserv, from the beginning to the end. Don't worry, I'll try to make it as simple as possible and I hope my pedagogical skills will be enough to make you understand everything. Let's start by the beginning, shall we ?

## Understanding the subject
First of all, I decided to read the subject carefully and to extract the most important informations from it that I will need to understand in order to complete the project. Here is what I found : HTTP, CGI, Configuration file, sockets, epoll, RFC, errno, server, web, client, request, etc.

## What is the web and a server ?
The web is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the Internet. With a web browser, one can view web pages that may contain text, images, videos, and other multimedia and navigate between them by using hyperlinks. A web server is a computer system that processes requests via HTTP, the basic network protocol used to distribute information on the World Wide Web. The term can refer to the entire system, or specifically to the software that accepts and supervises the HTTP requests.

When I write a URL in my browser and press enter, my browser sends a request to the server that hosts the website I want to access. The server then processes the request and sends back a response to my browser. The response contains the data I want to access, like a web page, an image, a video, etc. And sometimes, the server can also send back an error message if something went wrong (too many requests, server error, not found, no internet connection, etc). Don't worry, there is a lot of possible errors ðŸ˜‚
